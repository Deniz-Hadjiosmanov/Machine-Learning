# Machine Learning React App



## App Description

I made a Machine Learning app that recognizes objects with the camera of the device. For this purpose, I implemented the Tensorflow library. When you put an object close to the camera, the app draws a square/rectangle around the object and recognizes it by writing what it is.


## App Demo

To see how my app works, visit the following link: https://youtu.be/9VeNumn1VhY 


## Installation

Open the commandline terminal and clone the project in your folder using the following command:

```
$ git colne https://github.com/Deniz-Hadjiosmanov/Machine-Learning.git
```

Then, navigate from the terminal to the newly cloned project folder.

After that, type the following in the commandline:

```
$ npm start
```

This will start the React app.

To stop the app, press Ctrl + C on the commandline terminal. Then type "Y" and this will stop the app.

Close the tab in the browser after that.
