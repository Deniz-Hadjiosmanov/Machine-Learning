# PWA Individual App - Deniz Hadjiosmanov



## App Description

For my individual app in the PWA Development phase, I had to make an app that recognizes objects with the camera of the device. I made a React app and implemented the Tensorflow library. When you pu an object close to the camera, the app draws a square/rectangle around the object and recognizes it by writing what it is.


## App Demo

## Installation

Clone the project in your repository using the following command:

```
$ git colne https://git.fhict.nl/I477928/pwa-individual-app-deniz-hadjiosmanov.git
```

Then, open the commandline terminal in the newly cloned project folder

After that, type the following in the commandline:

```
$ npm start
```

This will start the React app.

To stop the app, press Ctrl + C on the commandline terminal. Then type "Y" and this will stop the app.

Close the tab in the browser after that.
